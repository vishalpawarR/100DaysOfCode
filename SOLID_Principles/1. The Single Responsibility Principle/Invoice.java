/*
 * Here is our invoice class. It also contains some fields about invoicing and 3 methods:

calculateTotal method, which calculates the total price,
printInvoice method, that should print the invoice to console, and
saveToFile method, responsible for writing the invoice to a file.
You should give yourself a second to think about what is wrong with this class design before reading the next paragraph.

Ok so what's going on here? Our class violates the Single Responsibility Principle in multiple ways.

The first violation is the printInvoice method, which contains our printing logic. The SRP states that our class should only have a single reason to change, and that reason should be a change in the invoice calculation for our class.

But in this architecture, if we wanted to change the printing format, we would need to change the class. This is why we should not have printing logic mixed with business logic in the same class.

There is another method that violates the SRP in our class: the saveToFile method. It is also an extremely common mistake to mix persistence logic with business logic.

Don't just think in terms of writing to a file – it could be saving to a database, making an API call, or other stuff related to persistence.

So how can we fix this print function, you may ask.

We can create new classes for our printing and persistence logic so we will no longer need to modify the invoice class for those purposes.

We create 2 classes, InvoicePrinter and InvoicePersistence, and move the methods.
